   “The most popular sports are the club sports, since most of the campus doesn't really support varsity sports. Football and other games are attended, but generally by other sports players. However, Guilford students really love their recreational Frisbee-it is one of the quickest growing clubs on campus. Also, bowling off campus once a week at a discounted price has also become rather popular, and it has some devoted fans.” - college prowler
